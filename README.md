# Express Note Taker

 
  ## Description

 
     This project allows me to practice and showcase Express.js, building routes that handle get and post requests, and coding delete requests by id through a simple note taking application. We also utilized separating concerns with a sensible and modular file structure and importing/exporting files to connect them.
